The reason why I chose this license in particular is because I don't want to put restrictions of any kind upon it. The program I am working on merely tweaks the window explorer panel to display folder size, and I do not desire any form of compensation for it. Putting it under any restrictions would be pointless due to the simplistic nature of the project. I want it to be completely free to everyone to use, contribute to, and distribute as they see fit.
